This project is a responsive web application that replicates some key functionalities of Vinted, including user authentication and account management, the ability to post, filter and sort listings, as well as secure payment processing powered by Stripe. I built this site as part of the 10-week web and mobile development training program I completed in 2024 with the organization [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/).

The site is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and is accessible [here](https://vocal-travesseiro-25a355.netlify.app/).
